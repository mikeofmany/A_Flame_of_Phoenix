# A Flame of Phoenix #

Ok, maybe the title is a tad...trite. But really, if we have a gaggle of goose, a murder of crows what then is a flock of Phoenix?
In this campaign I'm invoking a lot of love for many years running and playing in different World of Darkness games. Many successfully incorporating
the different splats and this is one I hope to recapture that.

So in A Flame of Phoenix, one may play from the v20 splats with some restrictions.

Vampire: The following clans are not allowed: Assamite, Malkavian, Nosferatu, Salubri, Samedi, Baali, Blood Brothers, Cappadocian, Gargoyle, True Brujah
Mages: The following groups are not allowed: Euthanatos, Progenitors
Werewolf: No Red Talons, No BSDs, No lost or forgotten tribes- Bunyip,etc; no Skindancers

As for Changeling - not to start, the ideal call to action has to take place in a banal setting.
No Wraiths, no other sub-splat. I may allow a bete if no werewolves are being played.
